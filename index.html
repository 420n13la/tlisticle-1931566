Your presentation is important. Make sure to be punctual yet professional, without overdoing it. Keep in mind that you are being evaluated on every minute detail, and every action, be it verbal or not. Your Non-verbal gestures go a long way, for instance, avoid touching or hiding your face, or any, nervous “fidgety” movements. In addition to your actions, your punctuality is also essential,  ideally you should show up early, but not too early, for this could make you seem to eager, and desperate, or you may have to wait a long time, in the event that another applicant is being interviewed before you, and you may be impatient during your interview. Lastly, dress code is the first thing the employer will notice. Make sure you look presentable, but also dress appropriately for the job in question. Say you're applying for a job in a supermarket or a restaurant, you won't be needing something overly formal, so a dress shirt and a tie should do just fine, regardless of sex. But if you intend to apply for a corporate job, you may want to dress more formally, a suit, typically grey, black, or navy blue, with a white dress shirt, (or blouse) is the ideal attire for the interview, ties do appear presentable, but open collar isn't a bad look, although bowties are typically too formal, or give off a more “party” vibe, (depending on the design) so its best to avoid them. But make sure not to overdress, showing up in a flashy suit, a tuxedo, or a prom dress is a big no, this gives off a cocky and obnoxious vibe, or it may see, like you’re overcompensating, or even worse, showing off, as if your trying to feel superior to the interviewer in question.

   <p class = "yeet"> The manner in which you speak is vital to your success during the interview. Its is important to express professionalism and confidence during your interview. Use proper language, and avoid slang, idioms, and swear words. But again, don’t over do it, using overly proper/ academic language may come off as obnoxious, and snobby, its not an essay after all, its important for the interviewer to know they’re hiring a human. Confidence is equally as important during the interview, make sure you know what you're talking about, or at least look like it, speak calmly, with confidence. Talking to frantically and quickly may seem like you're worried, or your hiding something. </p> <img src= "https://i1.wp.com/www.potentash.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nail-your-next-job-interview-e1506626685146.png?fit=640%2C384&ssl=1"  >

    <p>Now, the main reason you're being interviewed, your skillset. Now, the way you present yourself is of upmost importance, although you (ideally) sent the interviewers your Curriculum Vitae, that alone won't cut it. As the interviewee, it is your job to demonstrate, why <strong> you </strong> should be hired above the other applicants. For one, its may help to touch upon your previous successes during your career at previous jobs, provided there are any. Now, although you are trying to demonstrate your skillset to a possible employer, don't be cocky, telling them you're “The best that ever was” is a terrible idea, but if you truly feel you are among the best in your field, bring an example of your success with you, isn't a terrible idea, especially if you are in a more creative field. But outright telling the, you’re the greatest, is a terrible, but instead, you should let the employer find that out for him or herself, through your success stories, and examples of your past triumphs.  </p> <img src= "https://cdn2.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/39/36/job-interview-icon-design-vector-8053936.jpg"  >
